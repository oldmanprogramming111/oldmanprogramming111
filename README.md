- 👋 Hi, I’m @oldmanprogramming111
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, and working towards programming JS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS through the use of youtube video tutorials. I watch mostly Kevin Powell and one of his videos suggested going on frontend mentor. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would improve my skills. I have only been studing this for about a month. So not very knowledgable to help collaborate on projects as of yet
- 📫 You can reach me at cleveronealso@gmail.com
